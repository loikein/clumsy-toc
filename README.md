# Clumsy TOC

## Fork Notes

Ultimate aim: transform into a component that can be pasted to any website, responsive and customizable. 

Small aims:

- [] Click to fold and open 
- [] Scrollable 
- [] Looks good on mobile browsers 

Preview (beta): [a page from my blog](https://loikein.github.io/2018/05/24/notes-intro-c-rmd/)  
I deleted all the `.js` files for TOC, so it overflows. Bad.
