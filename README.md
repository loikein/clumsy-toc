# Clumsy TOC

## Fork Notes

Ultimate aim: transform into a component that can be pasted to any website, responsive and customizable. 

Small aims:

- [] Click to fold and open 
- [] Scrollable 
- [] Looks good on mobile browsers 

## Preview (beta)

I deleted all the `.js` files for TOC, so it overflows when the contents are too long. Bad.
